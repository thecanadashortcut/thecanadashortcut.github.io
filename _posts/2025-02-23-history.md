Toronto is a city rich in history, blending its past with modern life. Key sites include Fort York, a historic military site from the War of 1812, St. Lawrence Market, one of the oldest markets in North America and the majestic Casa Loma, a 20th-century castle, which offers a glimpse into Toronto’s aristocratic past. Explore these landmarks to uncover the stories that shaped Toronto’s development from a humble settlement to a bustling metropolis.

## **Casa Loma**

Casa Loma is a grand, early 20th-century mansion that holds historical significance as a symbol of Toronto's elite society during the period. Built between 1911 and 1914 by financier Sir Henry Pellatt, the castle reflects the wealth and ambition of its time. Casa Loma stands as an example of architectural grandeur, with its Gothic Revival style, expansive gardens, and over 98 rooms. It played a key role in the city’s development, representing the prosperity of Toronto’s upper class before financial troubles forced Pellatt to lose the property in 1924. Today, it remains a beloved landmark, offering a glimpse into Toronto’s early 20th-century aristocratic life.

## **Fort York**  

Fort York is a key historical site in Toronto, significant for its role during the War of 1812. Established in 1793, it was a military garrison protecting the settlement of York (now Toronto). The fort’s most notable event was its capture by American forces in 1813, during a critical battle in the War of 1812. This loss led to the destruction of parts of the fort and the burning of much of the town. Today, Fort York serves as a reminder of Canada’s military history, showcasing original buildings, artifacts, and reenactments that illustrate the early defense of Toronto and the broader struggle for Canadian sovereignty.

The Ontario Legislative Building, located in Queen’s Park, is a cornerstone of the province’s political history. Completed in 1893, it serves as the seat of the Ontario provincial government. The building's grand Romanesque Revival architecture reflects the province's post-Confederation growth and aspirations. It has witnessed significant moments in Ontario’s legislative history, including debates on key policies, reforms, and the development of Canada’s political system. As a symbol of democratic governance, the Ontario Legislative Building continues to be a vital institution, hosting debates and decisions that shape the province's future.
