## **Casa Loma**

Casa Loma is a grand, early 20th-century mansion that holds historical significance as a symbol of Toronto's elite society during the period. Built between 1911 and 1914 by financier Sir Henry Pellatt, the castle reflects the wealth and ambition of its time. Casa Loma stands as an example of architectural grandeur, with its Gothic Revival style, expansive gardens, and over 98 rooms.

## **Fort York**  

Fort York is a key historical site in Toronto, significant for its role during the War of 1812. Established in 1793, it was a military garrison protecting the settlement of York (now Toronto). The fort‚Äôs most notable event was its capture by American forces in 1813, during a critical battle in the War of 1812. This loss led to the destruction of parts of the fort and the burning of much of the town. Today, Fort York serves as a reminder of Canada‚Äôs military history, showcasing original buildings, artifacts, and reenactments that illustrate the early defense of Toronto and the broader struggle for Canadian sovereignty.
