# **Understanding Healthcare in Canada** 🏥  

📅 *Published: {{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}*  

Canada offers **universal healthcare**, but navigating the system as a newcomer can be confusing. Here’s what you need to know:  

## **Public vs. Private Healthcare**  
✅ **Public Healthcare:** Each province has its own health plan (e.g., OHIP in Ontario, MSP in British Columbia). Apply as soon as you’re eligible.  
✅ **Private Insurance:** Covers dental, vision, and prescriptions not included in public healthcare. Many employers offer this as a benefit.  

## **How to Access Healthcare**  
🏥 Find a **family doctor** through [Canada’s doctor directories](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/health-care-system.html).  
💊 Visit **walk-in clinics** for minor health issues without needing an appointment.  
🚑 **Emergency?** Call **911** or go to the nearest hospital.
